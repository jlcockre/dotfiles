This file is so that a year from now, when I'm setting this up again, I can remember what I did.

I'm managing my dotfiles based on these instructions:
  http://necoro.wordpress.com/2009/10/08/managing-your-configuration-files-with-git-and-stgit/

thought these ones are practically the same:

Here are the relevant bits:

cd ~
mkdir ~/.dotfiles.git
alias dotfiles='git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles.git/ --work-tree=$HOME'
dotfiles init
echo "*" >> .gitignore

Use "dotfiles add -f" to add files
